                        Hello! My name is Kevin, I'm a junior web developer with a passion for creating functional and visually appealing websites. 
                        My experience this far has been focused on HTML & CSS, JavaScript, PHP and I'm constantly expanding my skill set by learning new technologies and frameworks.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        I believe that a well-designed website can have a significant impact on a business's success, and I'm dedicated to delivering high-quality work that meets my client's needs. 
                        I'm driven by a desire to continuously improve and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in web development. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, play video games and learn new things every day. 
                    </p>
